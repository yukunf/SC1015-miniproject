**Overview**
---
This repository contains the project files for SC1015 mini-project.
With the rates of heart disease increasing at a rapid rate all across the globe, we aim to use different classification models to determine the likelihood of heart disease with attributes associated with heart disease.

Listed are the ipynb files used, which should be viewed in order.

1. EDA and Data cleaning
2. Baseline model- Binary Classification
3. Random Forest Classification with Upsampling of Female data points
4. Random Forest Classification by Gender
5. Support Vector Machine model
6. K-fold Analysis


**Dataset**
---
The dataset used can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction). It has approximately one thousand data points after removing duplicates, labelled as either having heart disease or no heart disease.
